# Bring-up anime..

### Filler episode 1...

> K, so I promised to explain the foreign Android ROM development nerd terms earlier and here I am.

##### Firmware:

> You see the shitty system that your phone runs on right now? And what made you actually read this guide? Yep that's it (kinda).

The system that comes with your phone is called stock firmware.
The one we're gonna make by the end of this series could also be called firmware but it never can be called *stock* or *stock firmware*, it is *custom* **NOT** *stock*.

###### Here's a qoute from kingoapp.com about *stock firmware*:

> Stock ROMs are the ones which come by default in Android phones or tablets. These are customized versions of Android developed by manufacturers and carriers to let users stick to their devices with unique looks and features. The "out-of-the-box" smartphones are all shipped with stock ROM.

This is roughly what *firmware* means: The shit that nerdy programmers and engineers at samsung make to turn your phone from a piece of plastic, glass and silicon into a fancy device that lets you read guides like this, WHOA... I know right? bet ya didn't know that before I told ya. ~~Actually ðŸ¤“ not only samsung makes devices.. why did you-~~ Because these guides are for normies like yourself I said samsung but yes, as nerd face said, there are various companies who make phones, ya didn't know that before I told ya, did ya?

Until next time, normy...

> WAIT.. DID YOU TOUCH GRASS YET?!
