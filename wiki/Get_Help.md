# Well, that didn't work: Getting Help

When things dont work, it may be frustrating. 

Believe me, its hard to not get frustrated after your tester gets pissed at you for sending them the 17th broken build.

The following are a few resources to get help. Also ensure to ask fellow maintainers of your device and the maintainers of your rom in their support group.

When asking for help, ensure you follow [general etiquette](#general-etiquette) and chat rules.

If you think the issue is device/device tree related, ask fellow device maintainers. They may have faced a similar issue in the past.

If you think that this is not a device bug but is a ROM side bug, make sure to ask the maintainers in their support group (NOT VIA DM!)
