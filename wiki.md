# Building Android from start to finish

## Getting started

Earlier, Cirrus CI gave the ROM Builders community servers for OSS developement of Android builds, as these builds need a lot of resources that most people don't have lying around, like double digit RAM requirements (GB), triple digit storage requirements (GB), a capable processor, a specific Linux environment, etc.

Cirrus CI has discontinued ROM Builders around Nov 2023. Now, [crave.io](https://crave.io) is providing Build Servers with a pretty similar Queue System. It is also a lot more flexible as it allows custom commands, has Docker image support, allows entering into build storage without starting a build, etc.

This guide attempts to help new and old users with Android development and using crave.io through Devspace CLI and alternatively, Github Actions.
