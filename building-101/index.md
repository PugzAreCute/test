This guide aims to teach users about the basics of android building.
If you want to build A12+ for devices not using linux 4.4 and up please refer to [Building android for legacy devices](../building-for-ultralegacy-devices/index.md)
For versions unsupported by AOSP refer to [Building Legacy Android](../build-legacy-versions/index.md)

>! [WARNING]
> Do not follow this guide inside Crave Devspace CLI, follow [this](../../crave/index.md). Instead because this guide shows things that are against [Devspace Rules](../../crave/rules.md)
