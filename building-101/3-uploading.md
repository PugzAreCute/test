# Building 101

## Sharing the build

The built rom is stored in `out/target/product/YOUR DEVICE CODENAME`. 
(eg. out/target/product/bacon)

Depending on which target you chose, the files here will be different.
Simply share your *.img files or the latest .zip file in that folder. Please ensure to have your build(s) thoroughly tested before you publicly release them.

If your rom does not boot, ask other maintainers for your device if your device needs specific patches or refer to [Debugging](./4-debugging.md) in order to grab logs.
