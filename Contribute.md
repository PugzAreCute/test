Do you feel like the content is incomplete, or hard to read? Or do you feel like it is not up to the mark or inadequate? 

Please note that OpenDroid is run by community members(often 1-2 people at most) so instead of harassing them via DMs(You know who you are), please try to contribute some content yourself! However, we are quite open to non-hateful constructive criticism. 

We welcome new content, restructuring ideas and improvements(especially spelling mistakes) so please do not hesitate to contribute or contact us.
